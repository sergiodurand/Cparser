# Cparser

Cparser is a compiler that translates a sub set of C language to Bluespec SystemVerilog (BSV) - a high-level hardware description language.  
It is tightly related to the [FSM2BSV project](https://github.com/sergiodurand/FSM2BSV), however it is possible to run it in stand alone mode.  
The goal is to translate a very small portion of C code used to describe a behaviors of states from a UML State diagram.

Cparser was built on top of JavaCC (Java Parser Generator)

This project was part of my Masters in Computing Science at University of Sao Paulo / Brazil.
